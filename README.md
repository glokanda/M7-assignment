This assignment helps build an employee management web app using HTML and JavaScript. 
Users can add new employees (ID, name, department, etc.) through a form. A table displays the employee list and each entry has a "Delete" button.
A counter keeps track of the total employees. You'll use JavaScript to dynamically add new rows, 
handle user interactions (adding/deleting employees), and update the employee count, 
focusing on DOM manipulation and event listeners. This assignment strengthens your understanding of HTML and JavaScript for building interactive web applications.
